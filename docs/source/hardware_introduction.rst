.. _pin_mocrocontroller:

Onboard Microcontroller
------------------------------

The Robot HAT comes with an AT32F415CBT7 microcontroller from Artery. 
It is an ARM Cortex-M4 processor with a maximum clock frequency of 150MHz. 
The microcontroller has 256KB of Flash memory and 32KB of SRAM.

The onboard PWM and ADC are driven by the microcontroller. 
Communication between the Raspberry Pi and the microcontroller is established via the I2C interface. 
The I2C address used for communication is 0x14 (7-bit address format).

Register:

ADC Read Value (0x10-0x17) 
  Reads the value of the ADC. Data is read back in 16-bit format [MSB], [LSB].
  0x17: ADC 0
  0x16: ADC 1
  ...
  0x13: ADC 4
  0x12: ADC 5 (Reserved)
  0x11: ADC 6 (Reserved)
  0x10: ADC 7 (Reserved)

PWM Pulse Width (0x20-0x2D) 
  Sets the PWM pulse width. Data is written in 16-bit format [MSB], [LSB].
  0x20: PWM 0
  0x21: PWM 1
  ...
  0x2B: PWM 11
  0x2C: PWM 12 (Motor)
  0x2D: PWM 13 (Motor)

PWM Prescaler (0x40-0x43) 
  Sets the prescaler for PWM. Data is written in 16-bit format [MSB], [LSB].
  0x40: PWM Channel 0
  0x41: PWM Channel 1
  0x42: PWM Channel 2
  0x43: PWM Channel 3

PWM Period (0x44-0x47) 
  Sets the period of the PWM. Data is written in 16-bit format [MSB], [LSB].
  0x44: PWM Channel 0
  0x45: PWM Channel 1
  0x46: PWM Channel 2
  0x47: PWM Channel 3

**PWM Frequency and Period Setting**

The PWM frequency is determined by the period (Period) and the prescaler (ARR). The principle is based on an internal clock of the microcontroller running at 72MHz. By dividing the clock with the prescaler, we obtain a frequency (Fp). Then, by dividing Fp with the period, we can calculate the desired frequency (F). Therefore:

F = 72000000 / ARR / Period

In general, we determine the frequency and period to calculate the prescaler. For example, if you need to drive a servo motor with a frequency of 50Hz and a precision of 12 bits (period of 2^12, which is 4096), you can calculate the prescaler (ARR) as follows:

ARR = 72000000 / F * Period
= 72000000 / 50 / 4096
= 351.6525
‚âà 352

Since ARR needs to be an integer, it will be rounded to 352. Therefore, you can set ARR as 352 and Period as 4096 to achieve an actual PWM frequency of approximately 49.937Hz, which is close to 50Hz.

The default values for the PWM prescaler (ARR) and period (Period) are 352 and 4096, respectively, resulting in a default frequency of 50Hz.

**PWM Pulse Width**

The pulse width corresponds to the number of periods. For example, if the period (Period) is set to 4096, 
and you set the pulse width value to 2048, you will achieve a 50% PWM output.

.. _pin_digital:

ADC
-------

.. image:: img/adcpin.png

The Robot HAT features four sets of 3Pin ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) pins, each spaced 2.54mm apart. These pins operate at a 3.3V power supply. The ADC function, offering 12-bit precision, is facilitated by an onboard microcontroller. Detailed instructions for reading ADC values are provided in the "Onboard Microcontroller" section.

.. image:: img/btradc.png

Also, ADC channel A4 is connected to the battery through a voltage divider using resistors, 
which will be used to measure the battery voltage to estimate the approximate battery charge.

The voltage divider ratio is 20K/10K, so:
A4 voltage (Va4) = value_A4 / 4095.0 * 3.3
Battery voltage (Vbat) = Va4*3
Battery voltage (Vbat) = value_A4 / 4095.0 * 3.3 * 3

.. _pin_pwm:

    * - 1 LED on
      - Greater than 7.15V
    * - Both LEDs off
