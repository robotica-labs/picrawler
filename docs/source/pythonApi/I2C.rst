.. _class_i2c:

class ``i2c`` - IIC Bus
===========================

**Usage**

.. code-block:: python

    from robot_hat import I2C

    i2c = I2C(1)                         # create on bus 1
    i2c = I2C(1, I2C.MASTER)             # create and init as a master

    i2c.send('abc')      # send 3 bytes
    i2c.send(0x42)       # send a single byte, given by the number
    data = i2c.recv(3)   # receive 3 bytes

    i2c.is_ready(0x42)           # check if slave 0x42 is ready
    i2c.scan()                   # scan for slaves on the bus, returning a list of valid addresses
    i2c.mem_read(3, 0x42, 2)     # read 3 bytes from memory of slave 0x42, starting at address 2 in the slave
    i2c.mem_write('abc', 0x42, 2, timeout=1000) # write 'abc' (3 bytes) to memory of slave 0x42, starting at address 2 in the slave, timeout after 1 second.

**Constructors**

``class robot_hat.I2C(num)``: Create an I2C object associated with the given ``num``. This allows you to use i2c on that device.

**Methods**

-  ``is_ready`` - Check if slave 0x42 is ready.

.. code-block:: python

    I2C.is_ready(addr)

-  ``scan`` - Scan for slaves on the bus, returning.

.. code-block:: python

    I2C.scan()

-  ``send`` - Send several bytes to slave with address.

.. code-block:: python

    I2C.send(send,addr,timeout)

-  ``recv`` - Receive one or several bytes.

.. code-block:: python

    data = i2c.recv(recv,addr,timeout)   # receive 3 bytes

-  ``mem_write`` - Write to the memory of an I2C device.

.. code-block:: python

    I2C.mem_write(data, addr, memaddr, timeout)

-  ``mem_read`` - Read from the memory of an I2C device.

.. code-block:: python

    I2C.mem_read(data, addr, memaddr, timeout)
