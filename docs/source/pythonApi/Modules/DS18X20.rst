class ``DS18X20`` - ds18x20 series temperature sensor
=====================================================

**Usage**

.. code-block:: python

    from robot_hat import Pin, DS18X20

    pin = Pin("D0")             # create pin object
    ds = DS18X20(pin)           # create a DS18X20 object

    ds.read(ds.C)               # read temperature in celsius(1)
    ds.read(0)                  # read temperature in Fahrenheit(0)

**Constructors**


``class robot_hat.DS18X20(pin)``: Create a DS18X20 object associated with the given pin object. This allows you to read temperature from DS18X20.

**Methods**


-  ``DS18X20.read`` - Read temperature with the giving unit. It returns a ``float`` value if only one ds18x20 is connected to the pin, or it will return a list of all sensor values.

.. code-block:: python

    DS18X20.read(unit)

-  ``DS18X20.scan`` - Scan the connected DS18X20 and return the roms address list.

.. code-block:: python

    DS18X20.scan()

-  ``DS18X20.read_temp`` - Read temperature(s) with the giving rom(s).

.. code-block:: python

    DS18X20.read_temp(rom)

**Constants**


-  ``DS18X20.C`` - Celsius
-  ``DS18X20.F`` - Fahrenheit
