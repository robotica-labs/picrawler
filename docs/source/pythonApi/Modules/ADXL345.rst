class ``ADXL345`` - accelemeter
===============================

**Usage**

.. code-block:: python

    from robot_hat import ADXL345

    accel = ADXL345()                     # create an ADXL345 object
    x_val = accel.read(accel.X)           # read an X(0) value
    y_val = accel.read(1)                 # read an Y(1) value
    z_val = accel.read(2)                 # read a Z(2) value

**Constructors**


``class robot_hat.ADXL345(address=0x53)``: Create an ADXL345 object. This
allows you to then read adxl345 accelerator values.

**Methods**


-  ``read`` - Read the value with the axis and return it. The unit is gravity acceleration(about 9.8m/s2).

.. code-block:: python

    ADXL345.read(axis)

**Constants**


-  ``X`` - x axis
-  ``Y`` - y axis
-  ``Z`` - z axis
