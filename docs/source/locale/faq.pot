msgid "**Q: Can the Robot HAT be used while charging?**"
msgstr ""

#: ../faq.rst:24
msgid "A: Yes, the Robot HAT can be used while charging. When charging, the input power is boosted by the charging chip to charge the batteries, while also providing power to the DC-DC step-down for external use. The charging power is approximately 10W. If the external power consumption is too high for an extended period, the batteries may supplement the power, similar to how a mobile phone charges while in use. However, it is important to be mindful of the battery's capacity to avoid draining it completely during simultaneous charging and usage."
